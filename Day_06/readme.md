# Event loop & Async programing

1. js is {<br>
	single- threaded (work on one thread means its not have full power of systeam)<br>
	non-blocking (code execution is never break)<br>
	Asyncronous (heavy task are on hold, working<br> in background,means js is not to wait anyone)<br>
	Concurrent (parelle work)
laungage
}

2. js have {<br>
	Call stack,<br>
	event loop,<br>
	callback queue,<br>
	some other apis,<br>
	and stuff
}
	
3. V8 have {<br>
	Heap (for memory allocation),<br>
	stack (Execution context)
}

4. Call stack :- One thread == One call stack === One thing at a time.
