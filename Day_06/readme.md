1. js is {
	single- threaded (work on one thread means its not have full power of systeam)
	non-blocking (code execution is never break)
	Asyncronous (heavy task are on hold, working in background,means js is not to wait anyone)
	Concurrent (parelle work)
laungage
}

2. js have {
	Call stack,
	event loop,
	callback queue,
	some other apis,
	and stuff
}
	
3. V8 have {
	Heap (for memory allocation),
	stack (Execution context)
